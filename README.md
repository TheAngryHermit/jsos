# JSOS

JSOS is a browser-based operating system written in vanilla JavaScript. It boots through BIOS and a bootloader into a terminal, and it persists files and settings using browser storage. Everything runs locally in the browser with no build tools or dependencies.

## Quick Start

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Or launch the hosted build: https://theangryhermit.github.io/jsos

## Requirements

- Modern browser with ES6 support (Chrome/Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Browser storage enabled (LocalStorage and IndexedDB)
- Keyboard input available (F2 for BIOS during boot)

## Documentation

(WIP!!!!) Full documentation is available in the Wiki:
